TPL specification #0 the library and the macro

DESCRIPTION
     The Tensor Programming Library (TPL) uses Nim's metaprogramming
     features to simplify notation of linear algebra and performs compile
     time optimizations.

OPERATION
     Any TPL operation would need to `import' the library and call
     the macro.
        import TPL
        tpl:
          # Statement with TPL specific DSL follows.

     Later specifications may omit the `import' and the macro call for
     the simplification of notation.
