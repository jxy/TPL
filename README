NAME
     TPL - Tensor Programming Library

SYNOPSIS
     tpl statements

     Index length [, lowerBound, stride]

DESCRIPTION
     TPL, a library in Nim, provides a familiar tensor notation
     for working with the Quantum EXpressions (QEX) lattice field
     theory framework.  It uses compile time macros to generate code
     from statements of tensor expressions, and in doing so transfer
     the complexity from user applications to TPL's code base.

     tpl
          The macro that receives a list of high level tensor
          statements and generate low level code.
     Index length [, lowerBound, stride]
          Generates an index type that runs from lowerBound, to
          lowerBound + stride * (length - 1).
